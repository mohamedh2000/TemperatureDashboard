Problem:

We want to build a dashboard for a user that shows the current temperature of the house. 
You can assume that the house temperature is constant at 70 degrees when you start. 
The user can increase or decrease the temperature by clicking "Heat" and "Cool" buttons on the dashboard. 
Each click will increase/decrease the temperature by 1 degree. 
The dashboard shows current temperature and the history of the temperatures over time.

The dashboard has the following components:

A "Current Temperature" text that shows current temperature: Example: Current Temperature: 71 
A graph, that shows the value of current temperature over time for the past 15 minutes
2 Buttons: "Heat" and "Cool"

You can design the frontend and backend in any language you choose. My preference is a react front end 
and python backend. Use of flask is encouraged. You should deploy this on AWS (use free tier) and 
provide me a link to your project. Also, send me your code for review.
